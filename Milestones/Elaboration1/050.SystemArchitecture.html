<p>
Our puzzle slider game will be run in a single instance. It will be GUI-driven, with the GUIs being created by Java FX.
There will be a different GUI for each menu screen in the game: one for the login screen, one for the main menu, 
one for setting up a game, one that will function as a pause screen mid-game, and one that will appear upon winning a game.
The program will be able to create and save user profiles and data on the machine on which it is running.
It will also implement Junit testing and build automation tools to help us test and debug code as we develop it.
The GUI, file storage, Junit testing, and automation tools will all be contained in their own packages with the program.
