		Our <i>Puzzle Slider</i> game will run as a .JAR program built using Maven.
		It will be GUI-diven, with user input propagating down the system architecture layers. 
		There will be seperate interfaces for each game screen: Login, Main Menu, Game Settings, Main Game, and Win/Lose.
		The program will be able to create and save user profiles and data using a JDBC connection to a Derby database. 
		It will also implement Junit testing and build automation tools to help ensure our code is being developed to the specifications we set for ourselves.

		Our app will be divided into packages for each high level system: Application, Component, Database, Image Processing, and Game Logic
