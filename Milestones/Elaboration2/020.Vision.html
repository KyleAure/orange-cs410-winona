<h3>Project introduction</h3>
<p>
	Create a <i>puzzle slider game</i> that allows users to select a photo to be scrambled, only to be put back together by sliding tiles around. 
	When the user exits the game, the puzzle progress is saved for them to continue to finish at a later time. 
	Introduce other game design features to vary game-play options and allow users to save their game for later completion.
</p>

<h3>Core requirements</h3>
<p>
	This game will need to meet the following core requirements to be considered successful in meeting our customer needs.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Store and retrieve player data.</li>
	<li>Player data authentication and security.</li>
	<li>User Interfaces</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Login or set up new player screen.</li>
		<li>Settings menu.</li>
		<li>Main game-play screen.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Integration with operating system file chooser.</li>
	<li>Image processing - crop to square, divide, and scramble.</li>
	<li>Time tracking.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key features</h3>
<p>
	The following key features are outside the core requirements, but will add value.
	These features will add value by making our game more competitive against similarly designed games, and offering more customization for our customers.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Custom Game-play: </b>The user will be able to use their own pictures.</li>
	<li><b>Difficulty: </b>The user will be able to change the games difficulty to their liking. Easy will have less square tiles to slide around, whereas difficult will have more, etc.</li>
	<li><b>High Score: </b>The game will keep track of your high score (lowest time to complete), and notify you when you beat your old one.</li>
	<li><b>User settings: </b>User will be able to change the theme of the game interface. User will also be able to select a photo from a set of stock photos or upload one of their own.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Main constraints</h3>
<p> 
	The game will be created with the following constraints.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The software must be written in Java</li>
	<li>The software must be developed within Rational Software Architect</li>
	<li>The software must have a GUI interface </li>
