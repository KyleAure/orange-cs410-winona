<p>
	For elaboration 1 we have completed boilerplate application code to ensure that automated testing and build infrastructure is working.  To see documentation for this working please refer to our <a href="../../README.md">README.md</a> documentation.
</p>
<p>
	For elaboration 2 we created boilerplate class code for each package's classes.  The package package diagram that we used was developed as part of our <a href="#UMLDiagrams">UML Diagramming.</a>
</p>
<p>
	We were able to complete our first GUI for the login system.

	As a part of this system we also implemented the use of a Derby JDBC driver to store user login data in a Derby database. Output from automated testing shows the ability for us to connect to the database, create tables, and add/validate users.
