    This section gives an overview of the contents of the Elaboration Phase 2 document

<hr>
<p>
    The documentation completed during the <b>Elaboration Phase 2</b> is to help our team establish the foundations for how our code will be written.
    To accomplish this goal our team will further explore external entities with which the game will interact (actors), and redefine the nature of this interaction in a high-level vision document. We will be creating diagrams and prototypes that help us better understand how to create a well designed piece of software.
    A successful <b>Elaboration Phase 2</b> document will include the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>An updated vision document</li>
    <li>Additional use-case models</li>
    <li>Proof of initial code and testing</li>
    <li>Build and system architecture elements</li>
    <li>UML diagrams</li>
    <li>Supplementary requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>
    At the end of the <b>Elaboration Phase 2</b> we should have a better understanding of our project scope, constraints, requirements, and a timeline towards completion.
