                <li>Success Guarantees: The display switches from the main menu to the current game interface.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Trigger: The user selects the button that leads to the game being played.</li>
        <li>Main Success Scenario:
            <ul>
                <li>1. The user selects on the button to play a game.</li>
                <li>2. The system incorporates the selected settings into the creation or loading of the game.</li>
                <li>3. The system outputs a confirmation message saying the game was created or loaded.</li>
                <li>4. The system replaces the main menu with the current game interface.</li>
                <li>5. The system displays the original image in use within a grid determined by the difficulty chosen.</li>
                <li>5. The system removes a single block from the image and grid to allow game movement.</li>
                <li>6. The system then rearranges the image in accordance to the blocks defined by the grid.
                    <ul>
                        <li>6a. If the user opted for loading a previous state, the blocks will be moved the same locations.</li>
                        <li>6b. If the user opted for creating a new game, the blocks will be shuffled and moved to random locations.</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>7. The user selects specified blocks to move them in valid “empty” squares.
                <ul>
                    <li>7a. If the user attempts to move a block to a location with a block already there, then the selected block will remain in its current location.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>8. The user continues to move blocks until the original image is made, thus causing a successful completion of the game.</li>
                <li>9. The system displays a message to the user congratulating them on their success.</li>
                <li>10. The system updates the user’s high score if the current score is greater than their current high score.</li>
                <li>11. The system replaces the game interface with the main menu.</li>
