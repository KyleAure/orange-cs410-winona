<p>
    The documentation completed during the <b>Inception Phase</b> is to help our team establish the basic business case for our game.
    To accomplish this goal our team will explore external entities which which the game will interact (actors), and define the nature of this interaction in a high-level vision document.
    A successful <b>Inception Phase</b> document will include the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>An initial vision document</li>
    <li>An initial use-case model</li>
    <li>An initial project glossary</li>
    <li>An initial survey of system architecure elements</li>
</ul>
<p>
    At the end of the <b>Inception Phase</b> we should have a better understanding of our project scope, constraints, requirements, and a timeline towards completion.
