  enjoy playing puzzle games why not play Puzzle Slider? This game is fun and easy to navigate, but in case

  <li class="ul">Upon the login screen you will see three buttons: "Login",
  "Sign up", and "JUST LET ME PLAY!". If you are already registered, you may enter your username and password and login.
  If you would like to register you can enter in a username and password and then select the "Sign up" button. If you are
  not wanting to sign in or register a new account you can select the "JUST LET ME PLAY!" button. After logging in/signing
  up/or selecting just let me play you will be taken to the Main Menu screen. From this screen you have the options to play
  a new game, load an existing game, check your previous high-scores, access game settings, and logout. If a new game is selected,
  then the Game Setup Menu is displayed. This gives you the option of selecting your difficulty, choosing a photo or uploading a
  new photo to play the game with. Once you have selected your difficulty and chosen a photo (or uploaded one) you will then be
  directed to the Game Session, here you will play the game until you select one of the following options: Pause, Game Settings,
  Save and Exit, or Restart Game. </ul><br></li>
