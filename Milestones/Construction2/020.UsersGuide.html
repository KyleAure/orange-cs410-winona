<h1><b>Users Guide</b></h1>
<p>This section provide the first draft Users Guide for the software</p><br>
<ol class="ol1">
  <b>Introduction<br></b>
  <ul>
  <li class="ul">The Puzzle Slider game is a fun way to kill some time. When you are feeling bored or just
  enjoy playing puzzle games why not play Puzzle Slider? This game is fun and easy to navigate, but in case
  you aren't quite sure what to do we have constructed this users guide so you can figure out those tricky questions.</ul><br>
  <h1><b>Getting Started<br> </b></li></h1>
  
  <li class="li1"><b>Quick Start<br></b></li>
  
  <ul>
  <li class="ul">Upon the login screen you will see three buttons: "Login",
  "Sign up", and "JUST LET ME PLAY!". If you are already registered, you may enter your username and password and login.
  If you would like to register you can enter in a username and password and then select the "Sign up" button. If you are
  not wanting to sign in or register a new account you can select the "JUST LET ME PLAY!" button. After logging in/signing
  up/or selecting just let me play you will be taken to the Main Menu screen. From this screen you have the options to play
  a new game, load an existing game, check your previous high-scores, access game settings, and logout. If a new game is selected,
  then the Game Setup Menu is displayed. This gives you the option of selecting your difficulty, choosing a photo or uploading a
  new photo to play the game with. Once you have selected your difficulty and chosen a photo (or uploaded one) you will then be
  directed to the Game Session, here you will play the game until you select one of the following options: Pause, Game Settings,
  Save and Exit, or Restart Game. </ul><br></li>
  
  <li class="li1"><b>Launching the Application</b></li><br>
  
  <ul>Currently to launch the application, you must open the project in an IDE that supports Java.
  You must open "LoginScreen.Java" from the edu.winona.cs.app package. Running the file will open an interface that allows you
  to login, sign up, or play as a guest.<br><br></ul>

  <ul class="ul">Upon selecting one of the options from the Main Menu Screen, the next interface will automatically pop up
  and give an abundance of options. On this screen you will be able to select a new game, load an unfinished game, check your highscores,
  change some game settings and logout.<br><br></ul>
